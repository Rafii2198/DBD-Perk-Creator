# DBD-Perk-Creator

DBD Perk Creator is a plug-in for GIMP that speeds up creations of custom perk icons.

## Installation
Download repository as ZIP (Press green "Code" button and chose Download ZIP). Open downloaded file and copy file called dbd-perk-creator into plug-in folder. To find plug-in folder open GIMP and select Preferences under Edit menu, a window will pop up, on the left side of that winodw press + button near Folders (it is at the bottom of the list), then you should see all different folders preferences, select Plug-in and then on the right side you should see where is your Plug-in folder.
Once you do that, you should open GIMP and then you will see Rafii's DBD category under Tools menu.

## Usage
When you use Perk Creator, a window will pop up, you will have to choose 3 folders:
* Folder with background and settings files - folder where settings file and your bacgrounds for perks are stored in. You can get settings file by renaming any example file from downloaded zip. Background files are .png files named by just number (for example 1.png, 2.png etc.). More on these two files in Examples down below.
* Folder with DBD icons - You can choose the folder with ingame files of perks.
* Output folder - Folder where you want your new perk icons to go. **ATENTION** You need to copy the content of ingame folder with perks into that folder, if you don't do that an error will apear.

When you select all 3 of these, press ok and it will take some time (arround 6 minutes on my computer) to generate all the files.

## Examples
In Examples folder you can see 3 example files.
* Example 1 is settings for old tiers of perks being Yellow, Green and Purple.
* Example 2 is settings for current tiers of perks being Purple, Purple and Purple.
* Exapmle 3 is settings for previous tiers of being Green, Purple and Purple.
Once you choose what example you want to use, copy it into **Folder with background and settings files** and rename it into **settings**
For every different color of perks you will need a different background file. Example 1 have 3 different colors and you will need 3 files called 1.png, 2.png and 3.png. Example 2 only has 1 color and so will need just 1 file called 1.png. Exapmle 3 has 2 color so you will need 2 files, 1.png and 2.png.
